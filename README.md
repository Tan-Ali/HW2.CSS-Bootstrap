# HW2.CSS-Bootstrap Description

For this homework assignment we were to create three different html files.  In these html files we created a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images.  While creating these things we were to use the Bootstrap's grid system and portfolio. Some of the minimum requirements include:

```
Functional, deployed application
GitHub repository with README describing the project
Navbar must be consisten on each page
Navbar on each page must contain links to About, Contact, and Portfolio pages
All links must work
Must use semantic html
Each page must have valid and correct HTML
Must Contain your personalized information (bio, names, images, links to social media,etc.)
Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system
```

## Requirements Met

In each of the html files, I used Bootstrap's Components to make the **Navbar**, **Cards**, and **Footer**.  I also used Bootstrap's grid system for the layouts including the **rows**, **columns**, **links**, and **photos**.

The **Navbar** is consistant on each page.  The **links** on the **Navbar** all work.  Each html page uses semantic html labeling the **header**, **main body**, and **footer**. Each html file was validated by **Markup Validation Service**.  In the About page, I have a **bio**, **my name**, an **image** of myself, as well as a **link to my linkedin profile**.
